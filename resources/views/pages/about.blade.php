        <h3>Corporate Governance</h3>
        <p>Corporate governance is the system of rules, policies, practices, processes and above all principles by which
            a Company is directed and controlled. While acknowledging the primacy of the shareholders, corporate
            governance essentially involves balancing the interests of a company's many stakeholders, such as
            shareholders, customers, suppliers, financiers, the government, and the community. The basic principles of
            corporate governance are accountability, transparency, fairness, and responsibility. Good corporate
            governance helps to build an environment of trust, transparency and accountability necessary for fostering
            long-term investment, financial stability and business integrity, ethical behaviour thereby supporting
            stronger growth and more inclusive societies.</p>
