               Today I have taken over as CMD/AVL. I feel privileged & honoured to assume the charge of CMD of AVANI, one of the leading Defence Companies among the seven created recently. At the outset, let me place on record that the company has been very ably led by the Board of Directors for the past nine months since its formation.
