        Today I have taken over as CMD/AVL. I feel privileged & honoured to assume the charge of CMD of
        AVANI, one of the leading Defence Companies among the seven created recently. At the outset, let
        me place on record that the company has been very ably led by the Board of Directors for the
        past nine months since its formation. The last nine months have been extremely challenging as
        the newly formed Company had to transition from a group of Government units into a corporate
        entity. The challenge before us was to perform while we transformed. AVANI has performed
        creditably and is
        on the path of growth and profit. I congratulate all my fellow Avanians for their dedication and
        determined efforts to turnaround loss making units into a profitable concern.
